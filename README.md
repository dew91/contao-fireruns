# contao-fireruns
Contao bundle for showing a list of fire runs filtered by year.

This Contao bundle was made for use on fire brigade websites. It allows to manage past fire runs including information as date and time, type of run, state at arrival and measures. This bundle provides a theme module for displaying the fire run records filtered by year.

Currently the following types are hardcoded in the translation files:
* alse alarm
* large fire
* small fire
* small fire (car)
* small fire (van)
* detector alarm
* detector alarm (disaster management exercise)
* medium fire
* medium fire (construction machine)
* medium fire (house)
* other
* technical support
* regional run
* regional run and large fire
* flood
* disaster alert

The opportunity of adding own types was not required in the project (the one, this bundle was made for) and will be added later - maybe!

The backend and frontend modules are currently available in 2 languages:
* English
* German

ToDo:
* translate module and template
